# SIEM
Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM)

•Introduction

Introduction To SIEM:
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), is a solution that enables companies and organizations to collect, store, analyze, and generate reports from security events and data logs.

1.] Central Surveillance: Modern IT infrastructures are often dispersed and contain numerous components: servers, endpoints, network devices, applications, and more. SIEM tools collect logs and events from these components in a central point, which allows security experts to monitor the entire infrastructure from a single location.

2.] Threat Detection: SIEM systems quickly detect abnormal or suspicious activities using correlation rules and advanced analysis techniques. This is especially critical for detecting unknown and complex attacks, such as zero-day threats.

3.] Compliance Reporting: Many industries require organizations to comply with certain security standards (e.g. PCI DSS, HIPAA). SIEM tools store the logs required for compliance with these standards and creates compliance reports.

4.] Forensic Analysis and Incident Response: After security incidents occur, SIEM tools store detailed log information for forensic analysis. This information is critical to understanding how an attack occurred and what its impact was.

5.] Automation and Integration: SIEM can integrate with other security tools to respond to security incidents automatically. For example, it can trigger a firewall rules automatically when suspicious traffic is detected.

>SIEM Components:

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are complex solutions that include many components and features. These components enable the SIEM to collect data from different sources, analyze this data, and eventually detect and react to security threats.

1.] Data collection: It enables SIEM to collect log and event information from devices, servers, and other systems on the network. Collection methods can be agent-based (via device-specific software) or non-agent (directly from the device’s log outputs). This collected data helps the SIEM process centrally for analysis. In summary, data collection is the process of obtaining log and event data from various devices, servers, applications, and other sources on the network.

2.] Log and Data Storage: Another important component of SIEM systems is log and data storage capacity. This helps the SIEM systems meet compliance requirements besides its capabilities to monitor, analyze, and report events. SIEM systems collect logs and event data from network devices, servers, applications, and other sources. This data is stored for extended periods of time for analysis, research, reporting, and compliance purposes.

3.] Log Normalization: Log normalization is the process of converting event and log data from different systems, devices, and applications into a standard format or structure.
Different sources use different log formats and structures. These differences make it difficult to consolidate, analyze, and correlate events. Normalization addresses these challenges by standardizing this data, making it an essential issue in SIEM projects

4.] Log Correlation: One of the key features of SIEM systems is log correlation. Log correlation helps detect a specific pattern or event by analyzing log information from different sources. Log correlation is the process of analyzing log entries from different systems, applications, and devices and combining them to detect a specific event, security breach, or other potential threat. Correlation is usually performed automatically, based on predefined rules or algorithms.

5.] Real-Time Monitoring and Analysis: Real-time monitoring is the process of keeping an organization’s network, applications, users, and other components under constant and immediate surveillance. Real-time analysis refers to the automatic evaluation of the data collected during this monitoring against certain security rules, algorithms, and other parameters.

6.] Reporting: SIEM reporting involves analyzing and compiling collected log and event data and presenting it in specific formats. These reports present complex data in an understandable format, often through graphs, tables, and text.

7.] User and Asset Tracking (UEBA): UEBA learns the normal behavior of users and assets (servers, devices, applications, etc.) on the network and is used to detect deviations from this behavior. UEBA creates a profile of “normal” behavior by analyzing the historical activities of a particular user or entity. If a user or entity displays activity that does not fit the normal behavior profile, this is considered an anomaly, and such activity can be processed as an alarm or warning.
